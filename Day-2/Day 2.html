                <h3>VISA</h3> redirects here. For the
                document needed to enter a country's

                It was launched in September 1958 by Bank 
                of America (BofA) as the BankAmericard credit 
                card program. In response to competitor 
                Master Charge (now Mastercard), BofA began to 
                license the BankAmericard program to other 
                financial institutions in 1966. By 1970, 
                BofA gave up direct control of the BankAmericard 
                program, forming a consortium with the other 
                various BankAmericard issuer banks to take over 
                its management. It was then renamed Visa in 1976.
                Nearly all Visa transactions worldwide are 
                processed through the company's directly 
                operated VisaNet at one of four secure data 
                centers, located in Ashburn, Virginia; Highlands 
                Ranch, Colorado; London, England; and Singapore.
                These facilities are heavily secured against 
                natural disasters, crime, and terrorism; can 
                operate independently of each other and from 
                external utilities if necessary; and can handle 
                up to 30,000 simultaneous transactions and up to 
                100 billion computations every second.
                <h4>Debit card swipe fees</h4>
                Visa settled a 1996 antitrust lawsuit 
                brought by a class of U.S. merchants, including 
                Walmart, for billions of dollars in 2003. Over 
                4 million class members were represented by the 
                plaintiffs. According to a website associated 
                with the suit, Visa and MasterCard settled 
                the plaintiffs' claims for a total of $3.05 billion. 
                Visa's share of this settlement is reported to 
                have been the larger.
                <h4>U.S. Justice Department actions</h4>
                In October 2010, Visa and MasterCard reached a 
                settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in 
                another antitrust case. The companies agreed to 
                allow merchants displaying their logos to decline 
                certain types of cards (because interchange fees 
                differ), or to offer consumers discounts for using 
                cheaper cards.
                In 1998, the Department of Justice sued Visa over 
                rules prohibiting its issuing banks from doing 
                business with American Express and Discover. The 
                Department of Justice won its case at trial in 2001 
                and the verdict was upheld on appeal. American 
                Express and Discover filed suit as well.

                <h4>Operating regulations</h4>
                Visa has a set of rules that govern the participation 
                of financial institutions in its payment system. 
                Acquiring banks are responsible for ensuring that 
                their merchants comply with the rules.
                Rules address how a cardholder must be identified
                for security, how transactions may be denied 
                by the bank, and how banks may cooperate for 
                fraud prevention, and how to keep that 
                identification and fraud protection standard 
                and non-discriminatory. Other rules govern what 
                creates an enforceable proof of authorization by 
                the cardholder.
